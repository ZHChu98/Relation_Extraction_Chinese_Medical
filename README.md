# Relation Extraction on Chinese Medical Corpus

## Brief Description

In recent years, people are looking forward to a revolution in the medicine area called "AI+medecine". However, due to the lack of structuralization of data, most of the medical datasets are in the form of natural language. We hope to find an automatic machine learning way to extract semantic relations among medical terms, in order to save manual work on the construction of knowledge base in the medical area.

## Project Structure

1. Preprocess the data such as parsing, pos-tagging, using *HanLP*
2. Implement several neural networks such as CNN, biLSTM on MNIST to test their performace.
Implement and compare various neural networks such as CNN, BiLSTM to extract relationship between entities given in the corpus.
3. Re-train the model on Medical corpus and optimize through adding position indicator, adjusting parameters.
